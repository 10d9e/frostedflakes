# Frostedflakes Java Serialization Library

Frostedflakes is a serialization library for Java with the following goals:
* lightweight footprint
* ability to fully serialize/deserialize regular Java objects
* experimental proxy and cglib object serialization

The endgame is to be able to snapshot any java runtime stack and reinflate it at a later time.
